## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed as:

1. Add `google_maps` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [{:google_maps, "~> 0.11"}]
end
```

2. Ensure `google_maps` is started before your application:

```elixir
def application do
  [applications: [:google_maps]]
end
```

3. In your application's `config/config.exs`, add:

```elixir
config :google_maps,
  api_key: "YOUR API KEY HERE"
```

Or you can use `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` system environment variable when running in `iex`.

If separate API keys are needed per request, they can be set through
`key` option, i.e.:

```elixir
GoogleMaps.directions("Toronto", "Montreal", key: API_KEY_1)
```

## Development

You'll need a [Google API key](https://console.developers.google.com) with
all relevant APIs (see above) enabled. Add your key to the environment as specified above.

Then run tests:

`mix deps.get test`

`mix test`
